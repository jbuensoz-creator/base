// tools/core/routing-vectors.mjs — precompute routing embeddings, a cross-invocation cache (Voie 2 precompute).
//
// The shipped semantic ranker (@ai-swiss/base-ranker-semantic) reads `resource.embedding` when present
// and otherwise embeds the resource text on the fly, caching it IN PROCESS. That cache does not survive
// a CLI invocation, so each `base route` re-embeds the corpus. Precomputing the vectors once (at build
// time) and applying them onto the resources makes routing fast without re-embedding, and keeps the
// vectors deny-aware by construction: only the same routable resources the Router scores are embedded.
//
// The cache is STAMPED (base.routing_vectors.v1): the file names the embedder it was built with and
// each entry carries the hash of the route_text it embedded. A cache that cannot say what it holds
// degrades retrieval silently — an edited use_when or a swapped model would keep serving vectors from
// another world. verifyRoutingVectors turns both drifts into visible facts (stale entries dropped and
// counted, model mismatch surfaced), never a routing failure.
//
// Confidential resources are NEVER embedded at build time: `base build routing-embeddings` may be
// configured with a remote embedder, and the egress promise (a `confidential` resource does not reach
// a remote model) holds on the build path exactly as it holds at query time.
//
// Pure over an INJECTED `embed` (a `(text) => Promise<number[]>`), so it is fully testable without a
// model; the CLI wires a real embedder (Ollama / OpenAI-compatible) from the semantic package.
