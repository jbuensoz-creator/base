// The local freshness gate for EVERY committed generated projection.
//
// One canonical source (tools/core/bootstrap.mjs and the build projections) is committed at several
// places: the root entry points (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, BASE_BOOTSTRAP.md, the Cursor rule), the tool
// matrix (.ai/tools.md), the routing index tree (.ai/routing/index.md + per-agent index.md), and the
// shape-B example projections (exemples/routage-pme). CI regenerates and diffs the ROOT copies
// (ci.yml); the example copies were gated only for CLAUDE.md/.cursor (exemples-conformity.test.mjs).
// This test closes the local gap: edit the canonical source without regenerating, and it fails HERE,
// before a push — naming the stale file.
//
// Discovery is by PROVENANCE, never by a hand-kept list: a committed file participates iff its head
// carries the machine banner («<!-- Généré par `base build …`» — line 3 in the bootstrap family, after
// the title; line 6 in the Cursor rule, after its frontmatter; line 1 in the index tree), the same
// provenance idea the doctor uses (a hand-personalised surface without the banner opts out; an absent
// file is an opt-in not taken). A floor on the matched count keeps the walk honest: deleting a
// projection cannot silently pass.
