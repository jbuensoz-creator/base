# BASE contributor: process disponibles

**Quand utiliser cet agent**: The contributor workshop for the BASE framework itself: develop and maintain BASE source, applied to itself and kept deliberately minimal.

## Process

### Decision sheet: [`decide`](skills/processes/decide/SKILL.md)
**Quand l'utiliser**: Make a decision sheet to collect the human's choices and approvals on several open points at once, instead of deciding one at a time in chat. Make a decision sheet for these open points; Collect my decisions and approvals on a list; I need to decide between options on BASE; Build a sheet so I can go through these choices
**Éviter si**: Apply a change that is already settled. Record one single decision durably.

### Implement a spec: [`implement`](skills/processes/implement/SKILL.md)
**Quand l'utiliser**: Build BASE source whose approach is already clear - write or modify code, spec leaves, agents and tools, with tests, ending green. Also the landing for a contributor fixing a bug or sending a patch/PR to BASE. Implement this BASE spec; Build this feature in the BASE core; Write the code and the spec for this feature; Fix a bug in the BASE CLI; Contribute a fix or patch to BASE
**Éviter si**: Audit or harden a user's existing BASE project (that is entretien-base). Work out the approach first (that is plan).

### Open a change: [`open-change`](skills/processes/open-change/SKILL.md)
**Quand l'utiliser**: Open a durable change record in decisions/ for a unit of work or an architecture decision, with its context, the choice and the alternatives. Open a change record for BASE; Record an architecture decision for the framework; Start a tracked unit of work on BASE
**Éviter si**: Plan or design the change before building it. Apply a change that was settled earlier.

### Plan a change: [`plan`](skills/processes/plan/SKILL.md)
**Quand l'utiliser**: Plan a change to BASE before building it - work out the approach, the architecture and the slices first, when the work is consequential. Plan a change to BASE before building it; Work out the approach for this BASE feature; Design the slices for this change to the framework
**Éviter si**: Implement an approach that is already settled. Just read the current state of the code.

### Understand the state: [`understand-state`](skills/processes/understand-state/SKILL.md)
**Quand l'utiliser**: Read the current state of the BASE framework - what exists, what is proven by tests, what is missing, and what to work on next. What is the state of the BASE spec? What is proven and what is not in BASE? What should I work on next in BASE? Show me the gaps in the requirements matrix
**Éviter si**: Audit or clean up a user's own BASE project (that is entretien-base). Create or improve a business assistant (that is createur-agent). Build a change that is already understood (go to implement).

### Verify the gates: [`verify`](skills/processes/verify/SKILL.md)
**Quand l'utiliser**: Run BASE's gates to confirm a built change is sound before committing or pushing - the matrix, the proof, the immutability check. Run the BASE gates before pushing; Check the spec discipline is green; Verify the requirements matrix and the immutability check; Is BASE ready to commit?
**Éviter si**: Audit a user's BASE project for health (that is entretien-base). Build the change first (that is implement).
