# Accessibility: commitment and status

Before adopting BASE, a public institution needs to be able to gauge what its accessibility is worth, and what it is not. This page sets out our commitment, the evidence we can show today, and the honest limits of that evidence. None of it amounts to a formal declaration of conformance: in our view, such a declaration remains a goal to reach, not a settled fact (see below).

This page is informational. It is neither legal advice nor a conformance audit. Each institution remains responsible for its own accessibility assessment, for any audit it conducts, and for its policy in this area.

## Commitment

For the documentation site and for Studio, we aim for:

- the WCAG 2.1 Level AA standard;
- the Swiss eCH-0059 standard (accessibility of online services).

This commitment is a design target. It guides our interface choices and our review work, without thereby meaning that conformance has been reached, or verified to date.

## An important distinction: mechanism and consigne

The [glossary](../reference/glossaire.md) defines the distinction between mechanism and *consigne*. For accessibility, it applies as follows:

- Mechanism, within the tested scope: an automated accessibility check runs within Studio's Playwright (end-to-end) suite. It fails when it detects serious or critical violations on the covered views and criteria.
- Consigne: the WCAG 2.1 AA and eCH-0059 target, like the care taken with page structure, contrast, and keyboard navigation, all rest on a design discipline. On their own, they do not amount to a verified guarantee.

## The evidence we have

Studio includes an automated accessibility test (`tools/studio/ui/e2e/a11y.spec.ts`), integrated into the end-to-end suite. Concretely:

- it uses the `axe-core` engine via Playwright;
- it analyzes the criteria tagged `wcag2a` and `wcag2aa`;
- it covers Studio's main views (the navigation, the Evaluations view) as well as a modal drawer, and also checks the behavior of hidden elements;
- it fails the build as soon as a violation with `serious` or `critical` impact appears, the report then spelling out the node and the measured values so that the failure stays diagnosable.

This test is one of the end-to-end checks the project runs. Accessibility thus takes its place in the net of automated tests, rather than in a one-off review quickly forgotten.

## The limit of this evidence

The reach of an automated check stays limited: here is what it covers and what escapes it.

- An automated check like `axe-core` covers only part of the WCAG criteria, on the order of a third according to common estimates for this tooling. It catches structural problems (missing attributes, insufficient contrast, incorrect roles), but it cannot judge the relevance of alternative text, the logic of the reading order, the clarity of the language, or the real quality of a complex keyboard path.
- The current test focuses on Studio's main views. It does not yet cover, exhaustively, every screen, every error state, or the documentation site as a whole.
- No complete manual audit has been carried out to date. No assessment with assistive technologies (screen readers) or with people with disabilities has been formally conducted and documented.
- As a result, there is, to date, no formal declaration of WCAG 2.1 AA or eCH-0059 conformance for BASE.

In short: we have a useful and continuous automated signal, but it is not proof of conformance.

## Known status

Taken as established (verified by the automated test, on the covered views):

- no accessibility violation of serious or critical impact on the tested main views of Studio;
- hidden elements and modal drawers accounted for within the scope of the test;
- the check integrated into the end-to-end suite, and therefore re-run continuously.

Pending (not yet done, or not covered):

- a complete manual audit of the documentation site and of Studio;
- testing with screen readers and other assistive technologies;
- assessment with people with disabilities;
- automated coverage extended to all screens and states;
- a dedicated accessibility check of the editorial content (plain language, heading structure, alternative text);
- a formal declaration of conformance and a documented accessibility feedback procedure.

## The declaration of conformance is a goal

A formal declaration of conformance (in the sense of WCAG 2.1 AA or eCH-0059) presupposes a complete audit, including manual checks and testing with assistive technologies. That work is not finished. We therefore consider conformance a goal we are actively pursuing.

We prefer to announce a real automated check, with its limits, rather than display a conformance we could not back up.

## To report a problem

If you run into an accessibility barrier in the documentation site or in Studio, report it through the project's tracking channel (the repository's issue tracker). Precise feedback (the page concerned, the browser, the assistive technology used, the expected behavior) helps fix it faster and extend test coverage.
