## Intent
"Explainable ranking" must be **honestly** explainable: every boost has a declared, inspectable source. The core ranker contains **no business vocabulary** — otherwise a "veterinary clinic" agent would inherit a devis bias — the core ranker's scoring and keyword derivation are neutral (FR-RANK-002). Business intent lives in adapters shipped *with the example that needs it*.

## Interface
```js
// tools/core/rankers.mjs   (imports node:* only)

// A Ranker: (resource, terms, ctx) => { score: number, reasons: string[] } | Promise<...>
//   terms   = normalized query tokens (NFD, diacritics stripped, lowercased, split on whitespace)
//   resource, ctx = architecture.md §2/§3

// Default, NEUTRAL. Field-weighted; one reason per field hit.
export function lexicalRanker(resource, terms, ctx) { /* see weights below */ }

// Declarative intent boosts expressed as DATA (a non-coder can author rules):
export function keywordIntentRanker(rules) {
  // rules: { [reasonLabel]: { when:(terms)=>boolean, require?: string[], boost: number } }
  return (resource, terms, ctx) => { /* see semantics below */ };
}

// Composition: sum scores, concat+dedupe reasons.
export function composeRankers(rankers) {
  return (resource, terms, ctx) =>
    rankers.reduce((acc, r) => mergeScore(acc, r(resource, terms, ctx)), { score: 0, reasons: [] });
}
```

`searchResources` builds `composeRankers([lexicalRanker, ...config.rankers])`, awaits the score for each resource, keeps `score > 0`, sorts by `score` desc then `path` asc, applies `limit`. Synchronous rankers still return synchronously; asynchronous rankers are supported for real embedding providers. A ranker that **throws** (synchronously or via a rejected promise) is caught and contributes a zero score with a `ranker:error:<name>` reason — the composition is **fail-closed**, so a broken optional ranker (corrupt alias, undefined ctx, unreadable embedding) degrades routing to exactly what the deterministic lexical floor decided, never an exception to the caller.

### `mergeScore(a, b)` — defined (resolves the under-specification)
```js
function mergeScore(a, b) {
  return { score: a.score + b.score, reasons: [...new Set([...a.reasons, ...b.reasons])] };
}
```

### `lexicalRanker` weights (baseline, minus the hacks)
Per matching field, add the weight and push a reason `"<field>:<term>"`:

| Field | Weight | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | 80 | `id:<term>` |
| `route_text` | 70 | `route:<term>` |
| `title` | 50 | `title:<term>` |
| `description` | 30 | `description:<term>` |
| `keywords` | 25 | `keywords:<term>` |
| `path` | 10 | `path:<term>` |
| `body` | 5 | `text:<term>` |

Matching is `normalized(field).includes(term)` for terms of 4+ chars; a **short term (≤ 3 chars) must match a whole word** (a token of the normalized field), not a bare substring — so «me» does not fire inside «commerciale», nor «ca»/«va» inside «publication»/«evaluer». Longer terms keep substring recall, so «calcule» still matches «calculer» (morphology without a stemmer). This mirrors the protection `routeAvoidReasons` already applies to the avoid-text (`routing.md`), brought to the forward match. **No** `intent:*` boosts, **no** `DOMAIN_KEYWORDS` (both removed from the core — FR-RANK-003). `route_text` is an **optional** field the Router populates from `use_when`/description (`routing.md`); it is empty for plain discovery, so it never changes neutral discovery scoring (FR-RANK-004).

### `keywordIntentRanker` semantics — defined
A rule contributes its `boost` (and pushes its `reasonLabel`) **iff**:
1. `when(terms)` is `true`, **and**
2. every clause in `require` **matches the resource**.

A `require` clause is a string; `|` separates alternatives (OR). A clause matches if **any** alternative is a substring of the resource's normalized *keywords + description* haystack. Example:
```js
keywordIntentRanker({
  "intent:prospect-commercial": {
    when: t => t.includes("prospect"),
    require: ["prospect", "devis|client"],   // needs "prospect" AND (("devis") OR ("client"))
    boost: 160,
  },
})
```
Rules are pure data + one predicate; no business logic in the core.

## The devis boost becomes an example adapter (not core)
```js
// exemples/assistant-devis/base.config.mjs
import { keywordIntentRanker } from "@ai-swiss/base/rankers";   // see open decision #2 (package exports)
export default {
  rankers: [ keywordIntentRanker({
    "intent:prospect-commercial": { when: t => t.includes("prospect"), require: ["prospect","devis|client"], boost: 160 },
    "intent:offre-commerciale":   { when: t => t.includes("offre"),    require: ["devis"],                  boost: 60  },
  })],
};
```

## `deriveKeywords` change
Keep the **structural** derivation (id/type/title/description/path words minus stopwords). **Remove** the `DOMAIN_KEYWORDS` table. Examples that relied on it declare `keywords` explicitly in frontmatter (most already do) or via their `base.config.mjs`.

## Two usages + robust rankers

The `Ranker` serves **two** consumers through one contract:
- **discovery** — `searchResources` ranks all resources for `base discover`;
- **routing** — the Router scores routable candidates (agents/processes) with an enriched `route_text` field (`routing.md`) and passes `ctx.mode="route"` for custom adapters that want to inspect the call site. Built-in rankers do not need hidden mode branches: `route_text` is the explicit routing signal. The **Ranker scores; the Router decides** — the two must not merge.

`lexicalRanker` is the **zero-dependency fallback**, not the final answer for hard cases (synonyms, paraphrases, implicit requests, heterogeneous vocabulary). It composes with `semanticHybridRanker` (also zero-dep, shipped): token overlap + token-subset aliases + fuzzy dice similarity + optional precomputed embeddings from an index/adapter — still a Ranker, still explainable (`semantic:alias:*`, `semantic:fuzzy:*`, `semantic:embedding`), selectable via `base.config` (`{type:"semanticHybrid"}`). For production real embeddings, BASE ships the separate `@ai-swiss/base-ranker-semantic` package: async Ranker, provider interface, OpenAI-compatible fetch provider, and an optional Ollama helper (`createOllamaEmbedder`, default model `nomic-embed-text`), with no model/cloud dependency in the core. Resource vectors are computed by the package on the fly (cached in process) or read from `resource.embedding`; `precomputeRoutingVectors` (`tools/core/routing-vectors.mjs`) precomputes them once at build time as a **cross-invocation cache** — the in-process cache does not survive a CLI run — and `applyRoutingVectors` injects them (the broker loads `embeddings.json` and applies it on each route via `loadRoutingVectors`; an absent or malformed file is a cache miss, never a failure). These precomputed vectors feed the embedding strategy's retriever (`route-broker.mjs`), enabled when both an embedding and a refiner model are configured (`routing.md`, FR-ROUTE-011). The package is also the **embedder behind `resolveEmbedder`** — the one seam (base-llm has no embeddings) that turns the Studio `routing.embedding_model` ref into the retriever's `embed` function, against the same shared provider registry as the chat/judge `resolveModel` (FR-ROUTE-013).

> **Requirement.** BASE provides an **official** semantic ranker path for production routing. The zero-dependency core keeps `lexicalRanker` as the fallback and ships a practical `semanticHybridRanker`; the maintained adapter package with real embeddings (`@ai-swiss/base-ranker-semantic`) is the recommended production path for larger or harder corpora (FR-ROUTE-006/008) without adding model/cloud dependencies to the core. A semantic ranker raises **relevance**; it never makes the routing **decision** (the Router's structural rules still apply).

### `@ai-swiss/base-ranker-semantic` — provider contract (FR-ROUTE-008)
The package is production-grade. An embedding provider is `embed(textOrTexts, ctx?) => vector | vectors` (`ctx.signal` optional), and every provider call is wrapped with:
- **Deadlines & cancellation** — per-call `timeoutMs`; a caller `AbortSignal` via `ctx.signal`. A timeout and an abort are *distinct* typed errors (`semantic.timeout` vs `semantic.abort`).
- **Bounded retries** — transient failures only (network, 5xx, 429, timeout — the typed errors whose `.retriable` is true), exponential backoff with **full jitter**, honouring a `Retry-After` floor. Config/auth/response/dimension/abort errors are **never** retried.
- **Batching + bounded concurrency** — `createBatchingEmbedder(embed, {maxBatchSize, maxConcurrency})` coalesces concurrent single-text calls into a few bounded, batched requests (OpenAI input arrays are batched natively).
- **Typed errors** — branch on `.code`: `semantic.config | timeout | abort | response | auth | rate_limit | network | dimension`.
- **Vector validation** — empty/non-numeric vectors rejected; a query/resource **dimension mismatch fails loud** by default (`onDimensionMismatch:"throw"`) so a stale index/changed model is caught, not hidden.
- **Configurable cache** — in-memory `Map` by default; any `{has,get,set}` for a persistent/org cache; concurrent calls for the same text share one request.
- **Observability** — `onMetric({provider, batchSize, attempt, latencyMs, cacheHit, similarity, dimension})` — operational signals only, **no text and no vectors**.
- **Security** — the core never calls a provider; nothing leaves without an explicit `embed`. `textOf`/`getResourceEmbedding` bound what is sent (`SECURITY.md`, `docs/trust/securite-donnees-routage.md`).

## The section-grain scorer sits outside this composition (FR-CORE-008)
`searchResources(root, q, {grain: "section"})` scores passages in `core/sections-search.mjs` and does **not** build its score from `composeRankers`. The reason is structural, and it is written here so an audit finds it rather than a second ranking system: a Ranker scores **one** resource against the terms and knows nothing of the others, while each term's weight at section grain is an **inverse document frequency computed over the whole passage population** (every candidate's passages, plus the parent cards' routing signals), which exists only once every candidate has been cut into sections. Wearing the Ranker interface would mean recomputing that population for each candidate, or hiding it in a cache behind the interface, and the composition would then be a facade over a scorer that ignores it.

Two consequences, both intended. Project rankers declared in `base.config` (`config.rankers`) apply at **resource grain only**, because a rule written against a whole resource has no defined meaning on one of its passages. And the section weights (heading 3, body 1, parent signals 2; whole-word matching, prefix match from five letters) live in `core/sections-search.mjs`, not in the table above: they are that scorer's own knobs, and the two sets never merge. Explainability is unchanged, each component still returning its reason (`heading:<term>`, `text:<term>`, `resource:<term>`).

## How it's proven
- **Neutral project (no config):** `discover` produces **no** `reasons` starting with `intent:` and injects no business keyword.
- **Opt-in intent boost:** when a project adds a `keywordIntentRanker` via `base.config`, the declared `intent:` reason appears with its boost — localised and inspectable, never in the core.
- **Opt-in semantic/hybrid boost:** when a project adds `semanticHybridRanker` via `base.config`, semantic reasons appear and remain composable with lexical reasons.
- **External semantic package:** when a project adds an async embedding ranker from `@ai-swiss/base-ranker-semantic`, `searchResources` and `routeRequest` await it without breaking synchronous rankers.
- **Provider robustness:** a transient 5xx is retried then succeeds; a 401 is typed `semantic.auth` and **not** retried; a malformed payload is typed `semantic.response`; a dimension mismatch throws `semantic.dimension` (or is skipped on request).
- Explainability preserved: every score component is a stated reason.
